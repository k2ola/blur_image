# Blur Image using YoloV7 segmentation
1. Preparation of a dataset with segmental marking of people (https://ecosystem.supervise.ly/projects/persons) - convert the dataset to the required format for yolov7-segmentation.
2. Training YoloV7-Segmentation model in the Google Colab environment.
3. Application of the model on the image.
4. Processing the detection result in Colab and blurring the image behind the mask using OpenCV tools.
